We often group assets by broad habitat types (e.g. woodland or pelagic) but can also group them by the components that make up ecosystems  (e.g. by species that span multiple habitats,  soils and sediments)."

They are grouped into four broad categories: provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services. As most measurable ecosystem services fall under the first three categories, these have been included in this search tool. Natural capital benefits are the positive impacts of ecosystem services on human welfare, they enrich our lives and underpin the economy and wellbeing. The extent to which individuals and society receive benefits is affected by their values and available resources."

This can be in non-monetary terms (e.g. heritage values or existence values) or in monetary terms (e.g. market price or willingness to pay)."

                    "description": "Pressures affect the state of natural assets (their condition, extent, or location) thereby changing their ability to deliver ecosystem services. Pressures include climate change, chemical and other types of pollution, biological disturbances, hydrological changes, and land or seabed use change, and are influenced by drivers such as population growth and societal needs for food, energy, wellbeing etc. Pressures also includes measures of the impacts these pressures have on natural assets where the pressure can't be directly measured.  In contract, Drivers are much broader and indirect in nature, generally creating pressures."
